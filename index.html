        <p>Firstly, thank you for your interest in me!  I'm a Web Developer who loves to code, 
          and I'm skilled in both front- and back-end techniques.  Click below to learn more about me, 
          or scroll down to summaries of the <a href='#projects'>projects</a> that I've built and my <a href='#contact-info'>contact info</a>.

        <p class='life-story'>I began coding in early 2018 and immediately loved it!  To me, coding is like creating an art piece, 
          where ingenious ideas come to life using logic as the only tool.  After teaching high school math for two years 
          (<a href='https://twitter.com/RHS_Principal_/status/930611022607593472' target='blank'>yes, I occasionally taught on a unicycle</a>), I decided that I wanted to be a full-time programmer.  I self-taught 
          briefly before beginning at Thinkful.  The Thinkful experience allowed me to jumpstart my learning, and I quickly 
          gained an understanding of full-stack Web Development through projects, pair-programming, and mentorship.  
          The collaboration within the Thinkful team was valuable, and I believe it raised the morale and production of everyone involved.  
          My goal is to work at a place where teamwork and collaboration is valued.
        </p>

        <p class='life-story'>In my free time, I enjoy making side projects and going to local tech Meetups.  Then, to convince myself 
          that I'm not actually just a coding robot, I also find time to run/bike (<a href='https://calvulcans.com/roster.aspx?rp_id=3650&path=mcross' target='blank'>I did Cross Country/Track in college</a>), 
          read, and rock climb at the local indoor gym.

        <div>
          <p class='project-content description'><span class='project-content-title'>Description:</span> This app serves as a manual-entry workout log for endurance athletes (runners and cyclists).
            It utilizes user authentication, and user-data is persisted in a database.  As a former collegiate athlete, I used to log my 
            workouts in a notebook like a barbarian, so I built this app to computerize the process.  Data-analysis feature using D3.js 
            is on my to-do list.  To preview the live app, use these dummy credentials:
          </p>
          <div class='project-content dummy-credentials'>
            <span class='dummy-login'>
              <strong>username:</strong> <span class='dummy-user'>user</span>
            </span>
            <span class='dummy-login'>
              <strong>password: </strong><span class='dummy-user'>password</span>
            </span>

            <span class='sidenote'>(If you try the 'Change Password' or 'Change Username' feature, please change them back!)</span>
          </div>

          <p class='project-content tech-stack front'><span class='project-content-title'>Tech-Stack:</span> This is a full-stack React App.  The state of the front-end is managed using a combination of Redux and stateful 
            components, and the browser's local storage is utilized for JSON Web Tokens.  Some other NPM packages that are used are redux-thunk, 
            react-router, react-spinkit and Moment.js.  The HTML is styled using CSS3 with a responsive and mobile-first design, and each component 
            is tested using Enzyme and Jest.  The app is continuously deployed on Netlify.
          </p>
          <p class='project-section tech-stack back'>The back-end is written in Node.js and Express.  Users' passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.  
            All user data is persisted using MongoDB, hosted on mLab.  Database queries are written using Mongoose, and I wrote my own 
            middleware function to verify incoming JSON Web Tokens.  The back-end utilizes Mocha &AMP; Chai for testing, TravisCI for continuous 
            integration and Heroku for continuous deployment.
